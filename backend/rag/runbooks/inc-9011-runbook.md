# INC-9011 INC-9011 orders database replica lag response runbook

Runbook checklist for responding to INC-9011.

## Triage
1. Confirm severity HIGH and affected service orders-db.
2. Collect logs, metrics, and dependency status.
3. Determine whether change/deployment regression is likely.

## Remediation Steps
1. Apply safest reversible action first.
2. Validate recovery with objective metrics.
3. Record final root cause and preventive action.

## Purpose
Clarify when this runbook should be used and what incident outcome it targets.

## Preconditions
- Required access level and tooling
- Any approvals required before taking action
- Safety constraints for production changes

## Triage Signals
- Confirm impacted service and severity
- Verify alert freshness and blast radius
- Identify whether this is likely change-related

## Investigation Steps
1. Capture current symptoms, metrics, and logs.
2. Check recent deploy/change events and dependency health.
3. Isolate probable fault domain before remediation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Run the top 3 service-specific diagnostics for this alert.
2. Compare current telemetry against known-good baseline.
3. Confirm if issue is transient, recurring, or systemic.
4. Decide: remediate now, escalate, or monitor with guardrails.

## Validation
- Alert state transitions to healthy/suppressed as expected
- Key SLO/SLI metrics recover to threshold
- No collateral degradation in dependent services

## Rollback
1. Revert the last remediation action if validation fails.
2. Restore prior known-good configuration or release.

## Escalation
- Escalate to owner team if unresolved after first response cycle
- Escalate immediately for data loss, security risk, or expanding blast radius

## Notes
- Capture root cause hypothesis and final confirmed cause
- Add follow-up prevention tasks and owners
