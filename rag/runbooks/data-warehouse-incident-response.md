# Data Warehouse Incident Response Runbook

This runbook is derived from RAG_doc.docx and covers the standard operating procedures for incident triage,
investigation, remediation, and escalation across ETL, ingestion, warehouse, streaming, and reporting alerts.

## Standard Operating Procedure
1. Identify the alert id, service, severity, and affected data domain.
2. Check the orchestration layer first: Airflow, CDC, streaming consumers, and downstream dependencies.
3. Validate freshness, counts, and the latest successful pipeline execution.
4. Use safe remediation first: retry, backfill, restart, or scale depending on the alert type.
5. Confirm recovery with data validation, record counts, and dashboard refresh.
6. Capture the resolution and update the incident knowledge base.

## Cross-Alert Response Matrix
- DW-1001 ETL Job Failure | airflow | CRITICAL | etl_failure
- DW-1002 Data Load Delay | data-ingestion | HIGH | sla_breach
- DW-1003 Source System Unavailable | oracle-source | CRITICAL | source_connectivity
- DW-1004 Kafka Consumer Lag High | kafka-ingestion | HIGH | streaming
- DW-1005 Data Quality Check Failed | dq-framework | CRITICAL | data_quality
- DW-1006 Missing Daily Partition | sales-fact-table | HIGH | partition_missing
- DW-1007 Warehouse Storage Usage High | snowflake | MEDIUM | capacity
- DW-1008 Query Performance Degradation | data-warehouse | HIGH | performance
- DW-1009 Replication Lag Exceeded Threshold | replication-service | HIGH | replication
- DW-1010 Schema Drift Detected | customer-ingestion | CRITICAL | schema_change
- DW-1011 Late Arriving Data | transaction-feed | MEDIUM | data_latency
- DW-1012 Dimension Load Failure | customer-dimension | HIGH | etl_failure
- DW-1013 Fact Table Record Count Mismatch | sales-fact | CRITICAL | reconciliation
- DW-1014 Airflow Scheduler Down | airflow | CRITICAL | scheduler
- DW-1015 Spark Executor Memory Exhausted | spark-cluster | HIGH | resource_utilization
- DW-1016 Failed CDC Processing | cdc-pipeline | CRITICAL | change_data_capture
- DW-1017 Business SLA Missed | daily-sales-report | CRITICAL | sla_breach
- DW-1018 Data Pipeline Backlog Growing | data-pipeline | HIGH | backlog
- DW-1019 Unauthorized Data Access Attempt | data-warehouse | CRITICAL | security
- DW-1020 Dashboard Refresh Failure | powerbi-reporting | HIGH | reporting


## Investigation Checklist
- Inspect Airflow DAG and scheduler health.
- Validate source connectivity and replication health.
- Review data quality checks, schema drift, and partition completeness.
- Check consumer lag, backlog growth, and warehouse performance.
- Review audit logs for any security or permission anomalies.

## Remediation Principles
- Prefer reversible actions first.
- Backfill or reprocess when data correctness is impacted.
- Scale or restart when infrastructure is saturated or unhealthy.
- Escalate immediately for security-related alerts.

## Automation Examples
- airflow dags trigger <dag_name>
- systemctl restart airflow-scheduler
- kubectl scale deployment kafka-consumer --replicas=5
- Restart refresh or replication jobs after validation.

## Purpose
Clarify when this runbook should be used and what incident outcome it targets.

## Preconditions
- Required access level and tooling
- Any approvals required before taking action
- Safety constraints for production changes

## Triage Signals
- Confirm impacted service and severity
- Verify alert freshness and blast radius
- Identify whether this is likely change-related

## Investigation Steps
1. Capture current symptoms, metrics, and logs.
2. Check recent deploy/change events and dependency health.
3. Isolate probable fault domain before remediation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Run the top 3 service-specific diagnostics for this alert.
2. Compare current telemetry against known-good baseline.
3. Confirm if issue is transient, recurring, or systemic.
4. Decide: remediate now, escalate, or monitor with guardrails.

## Remediation Steps
1. Apply the safest reversible action first.
2. If unresolved, proceed to deeper corrective action.
3. Record what changed and expected recovery signal.

## Validation
- Alert state transitions to healthy/suppressed as expected
- Key SLO/SLI metrics recover to threshold
- No collateral degradation in dependent services

## Rollback
1. Revert the last remediation action if validation fails.
2. Restore prior known-good configuration or release.

## Escalation
- Escalate to owner team if unresolved after first response cycle
- Escalate immediately for data loss, security risk, or expanding blast radius

## Notes
- Capture root cause hypothesis and final confirmed cause
- Add follow-up prevention tasks and owners
